Dear PIA Managers,

I re-attach my emails below and further note the following:

Still no reply from PIA regarding the promised technician to repair the Kitchen Downlight, when will you send?  If not, why not?

No access request for inspection to prospective tenants is noted.  When you do have such access request, please ensure your request is accompanied with owner's undertaking to clean/sanitise the apartment after each inspection.

Noted your confirmation to conduct inspection at 4pm on 23 October 2020. Please be sure to send me a ""blank"" Condition Report in readiness..

I checked my bank, there is no reason why my rent payment made on 8 October 2020  has not reached PIA by now, I again request your rent receipt in accordance with the Tenancies Act .

Subject: Unit 1307/42-44 Pemberton Street, BOTANY - Rent Deduction

Hi Sue & Leo,

Hope this email find you and your family are very well.

Following the current economic circumstances, your tenant has requested a rent reduction to $580 with the market price. 

Fact of the current tenancy:

Your current rental income is $660 per week, the tenant has lived in this property since 17/11/2017 and the contract is set to end on 17/05/2018

As the lease is ending soon there is a risk that he may vacate if her rent is not lowered to be in line with the market.

Facts of current market

Below are links showing similar properties in the area for significantly lower rent of around $560-610 p/w 

https://www.domain.com.au/24-21-23-myrtle-st-botany-nsw-2019-14655015

https://www.domain.com.au/2-51-hanna-st-botany-nsw-2019-14649531

https://www.domain.com.au/2-51-hanna-st-botany-nsw-2019-14649531

These properties indicate that rent prices in the area have dropped significantly due the COVID-19 pandemic. If you do not lower the rent the tenant may vacate once the lease expires.

Our Suggestion

Given these circumstances we would suggest a reduction in the rent to $580 p/w in exchange for a renewal of the lease for 6 or 12 months and discuss further based on the tenants response.

Having said this, do you have any preference to provide rent deduction at this stage and do you have any particular conditions ?

Are there any other matters which requires further clarification? 

If you’ve any further concerns or inquiries, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

One Spotlight in the kitchen is not working, the main entry door seems to require a little adjustment and it gets stuck sometimes requiring pressure to be open/closed. 

Remote control for the garage isn’t working. 

Please advise your comments. 

Thanks, Faustus.

The reduction of rent by government is conditional, this requires the tenant to provide proof of the loss during this period, which cannot exceed $1500 (now government change this amount to $3000).

We need to provide all the materials to the government, we need to provide all the documents to the government and then the government will make the decision.

Hi Bowen,

The waiver of rent is not unconditional. Instead it is based on the approval of government subsidiary. Correct?

I have doubt on this as I am required to signed the agreement even without any prior approval from government on the subsidiary.

Thanks,

Jimmy

Hi Bowen,

If I understand correctly, this will not impact my rental income. Based on the amount the government subsidizes, it will be deducted from the rent, correct?

If that is the case, please proceed with the application on behalf of me.

Hi we’ve decided we would definitely want the place. I think John said he’s going to speak to you about moving out the weekend before the 13th (6th/7th) so he can clean and prepare the apartment for inspection during that week and we can move in on the 13th. This sound ok?

Thanks, Luke

Subject: Severe Water Damage

Hi Yuan,

I raised this issue with Jeffrey over a year ago and never heard anything back about this issue despite multiple reminders via email and phone last year. I have also raised this issue in every inspection conducted by PIA, with no response. 

I have discovered that there is a significant risk of mould growing behind the bedroom wall due to the vast amount of water that is coming into the bedroom. 

The water is also making the bedroom carpet wet, it's disintegrating the walls and allowing pests in, and I've had to continuously move furniture so that it doesn't get ruined. Not only that, the sound of rain coming through the window at night is making it difficult to sleep.

It's getting to the point where we may need to leave the property if the issue isn't fixed due to the mould risk as this is a severe safety hazard. 

Can you please organise someone to come inspect and fix this immediately. 

Thanks,
Callan

"Hi Bowen,

Hope you are doing well also.

I am sorry to hear of the trouble you had experienced with this unit.

Loss of rent, compensation, cleaning costs and moving out costs are not the responsibility of the Owners Corporation, nor would it be considered with the buildings insurance as building defects are an exclusion of the insurance policy.

Whilst I can put a request to the Strata Committee to consider contributing to this cost, I highly doubt this would be successful. Please let me know if you wish for us to make this request?

I would recommend that you contact Toplace regarding this matter to contribute to this cost.

Please feel free to contact me to discuss further if need be.

Enjoy your week ahead.

Hi Rebekah,

Hope you are well.

On 28/01/2021, the tenant reported us that there is a leaking issue in their master bedroom, and was causing a power outage. The tenant asked 50% rent reduction and compensation. Later, the tenant apply the NCAT, and the NCAT member make the final order on 09/06/2021, and NCAT decided give 50% rent reduction to the tenants(from 28/01/2021 to 05/03/2021), and $1220 compensation for moving and cleaning costs (Total is $2990.00), and fully return their bond. 

We have tried claim the rent loss by the landlord insurance. However, they rejected the claim for the compensation, because the reason for the loss of the landlord is building defect. 

Please let me know, whether strata or builder will bear the loss for the landlord. Thank you.

If you ever have any further enquires. Please do not hesitate to reply me directly via this email.

Have a nice day.

"Hi Ricky Marc Awerbuch & Shoshana Sarah Klein,

Thanks for your email.

We'll offer you a 50% rent deduction from 28/01/2021 unit the builder completely fixed the leaking issue for you. 

Because we don't know when the builder will fix it, and we need to claim insurance after they fixed the issue. Therefore, we suggest you can still pay the full rent now, and we will refund you once the leaking issue is solved. 

Also, if you pay 50% during this time, you will receive the arrears send by the system automatically, and it will shows on your tenant ledger as a record. 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi Bowen, 

In response to your email
today we wish to clarify the following after my discussion with NSW Department
of Fair Trading today. 

Under Section 43 of The
Residential Tenancies Act, as we do not have use of the main bedroom and we now
have to use the living room as an alternate sleeping space, we are entitled to
a reduced rent. This was agreed upon from you and therefore we do not need to
pay the full amount of rent until the repairs are remedied.

Hi Bowen 

Thanks for coming back to us and we are will to accept the reduction of rent until the repairs are complete.

Just to clarify, our rent is paid monthly from 6th of the month to the 5th of the next month. 

We are currently paid up to the 5th February according to my records.

According to me with the reduction in rent from the 28th January up to the 5th February we have currently have over paid by $379.31. From the 6th February to the 5th March, I will pay the reduced rate of rent for the month which should be $1281.85. With the overpayment of rent and the reimbursements for the lights I will be paying $787.41. Can you please confirm this amount is correct and get back to me so I can pay the correct rent.

I look forward to hearing from you

Hi Ricky Marc Awerbuch & Shoshana Sarah Klein,

Thanks for your email.

The landlord agreed to give a 50% rent deduction from the last Thursday until it is repaired. 

And also, the landlord agreed to pay the invoice for the lamps.

However, for the parking space, you mentioned in the email, we already sent the notice to the building manager Wil when you first time notices us by email.

The building manager arranged you to park your car in the visitor car park. Therefore, we do NOT accept your $100 dollars per week rent deduction request.

Please let me know your suggestion. Thank you.

Have a nice day.

Hi Bowen

As per our conversation this morning we are requesting a 50% rent reduction.

We discussed the issues below:

1.	We have not had car spots since May 2020 due to a leak above the cars. This leak damaged both the cars. The leak has not yet been fixed. I request compensation of $100 a week back paid from 1 June 2020 to date as we have not had parking spaces since then and have had to park outside on many occasions. We still do not have parking spaces and moving forward I would like a rent reduction of $100 a week covering both parking spaces. This totals $3500 compensation from 1 June 2020 up until now.
2.	We reported marks on the roof of the master bedroom December 2020. A handyman attended and suggested to us to paint over the mouldy patch. Nothing further was ever attended to. As we now know this was the probably the initial signs of the water damage that we have now experienced. On Thursday 28 January there was a leak in the master bedroom through the light fitting which caused all the electricity to trip and we had no lights in the apartment for 24 hours. I was authorised to buy some lamps ( receipt attached for reimbursement). 

The situation as it stands now is that we cannot use the master bedroom as there are no lights in the room and the fear of water dripping and not knowing where this water is coming from. The damp is a health hazard as we have a child who has health issues. We are now using the living room as a bedroom. In fact, we have lost 2 rooms

It is now day 5 since the problem occurred and we do not have a timeline of when and how this problem is to be fixed. This is very frustrating and it is really not up to me to be liaising with the builder, the strata, the building manager and yourselves. I had to take a day’s leave from work to try and sort issues out on Thursday. You are my contact and you need to be proactive in getting this sorted out and repaired asap, in the meantime I request 50% rent reduction as compensation until this has been repaired and moving forward, I request a $100 rent reduction for 2 car spaces that we do not have.

I expect you to be in contact with me twice daily keeping me updated on the progress as I do have a job and cannot be expected to manage this repair.

I trust you will deal with this persistently until it is sorted out 

Kind Regards

Ricky

Hi Binbin,

Hope you are well.

Refer to the conversation on the phone, the electricity power failure caused by the water leaking issue, at the same time, the property becomes unsafe to live in.

Our suggestion is to stop charge tenants' rent until the problem is solved because it is inhabitable. The tenant can use the rent to find temporary accommodation.

For the rental loss, we can try to claim by the landlord insurance, once the issue is solved.

Please know if you agree, or if you have any suggestions. Thank you.

Hi Bowen,

I have been having issues with my WIFI provider TPG for the last week. They are suggesting the NBN box that is in the building is not strong enough to reach my wifi which is causing drop outs of the internet. So they have suggested me to contact the building manager like I did and Will was contacting you as someone needs to come out and activate a data port into the unit.

I don’t have photos as I don’t know where the box is in the building. But this is what my modem is showing with no internet light on. [Image.jpeg<cid:A70A40CF-F884-47D9-BD0C-A932651F33ED>]

Hi there Bowen!

Zoe is, unfortunately, having issues with her NBN box which I believe may have a low battery or a plug has been un-plugged,

Do you have any information on this regarding your most recent inspection of the property?

If not, can we please arrange for this NBN box to be looked at?

I thank you in advance!

Kind regards

It really hard to quote work that involves fault finding. If it’s just 2 switch mechs and completed in conjunction with the 2 power points it will be $50 on top of ten last quote I gave you.

Or if you send a quote request we can attend and give you a quote of the whole job or we can call you when on site for approval if needed.

Subject: 4302: Mailbox Break-in

Hi there Selina! 

Happy Tuesday, 

Unfortunately over the weekend unit 4302’s mailbox has been forced open.

 I have reviewed 78 hours worth of footage from the 25/09/2020-29/09/2020 although I am unable to catch the thief in the act as there is no sensor light for building 4 that catches movement. 

I will bring this information forward to the commitee so I can try and get this sensor approved for mail theft ( building 5 has a bright sensor light that catches movement, as of the sensor light being installed we have had no further break ins). 

I have attached pictures for you to view of 4302’s mailbox that has clearly been forced open. 

Can we please have a technician to attend site to repair this mailbox? I do believe a new key needs to be cut also. 

Again pictures are attached and please call if any further questions or concerns.

Kind regards, 

<cid:image001.jpg@01D697DD.2C386BB0>

"Hi Bowen, 

Recently we’ve been having issues with our oven again. The fan is making a loud, scratching noise. I believe this is the same issue we had last time. 

While the oven is in working order for now, I’m afraid it will stop working again very soon. 

Please can I request to have a technician come and have a look at it again. 

Thankyou

    Hi Selena,

    Hope you’re keeping well. 

    About two weeks ago building 4  of 42-44 Pemberton Street, Botany underwent a pest control. 

    Since then, we have been getting cockroaches inside our apartment. We have never had an issue before. There have been a couple times I have gone into the bin room and seen many crawl all over the bins. When I come back with my phone to take a picture, they have scurried away. 

    What is your advise on this? I cannot have the little bates in my apartment as I have a dog and 2yo.

Hi Selina

Thanks for your follow up 

Flyscreens arent always on the top of peoples minds when they are looking through a property, they may not even notice they dont have them until after they move in.! but keep in mind that often doing the small things will make your tenants appreciate you and your property a little more and stay there longer....

Yes one of the balcony doors have flyscreen but the other one should be open for the air circulation, if we close the other one we will stop airflow and room temperature goes up. 

Anyway, we cannot pay half of the price because flyscreen is for the property and it will remain in the property after we move out, but since owner can spend half of the total price which is 300 $ , we can prioritize our request. (Our priority is study room and sitting room ). please ask the owner to install flyscreen for study (200$), and spend remaining 100 $ to install fiber glass insect screen (linear meter) for the sitting room balcony door. (We use other balcony door for going out and in) 

Thanks

HI Ana,

Please see the owner’s instruction and let me know how do you think 

“We have got price estimation from my handyman. Flyscreen door for main bedroom is close to $400, while flyscreen for study room is close to $200. Since the cost is not low and most apartments have no flyscreen, we would like the tenants to contribute half of actual price shown on invoice of the job. Please talk to the tenants whether they agree. Thank you.

There are two sliding doors between sitting room and balcony. One of them has flyscreen which is good enough.”

Hi Selina

This is to confirm that my wife spoke with the strata manager Roni just now and has been informed that the tenants damaged the gate, the strata then charged our account for repair of the gate in the amount of $462. This amount should have been paid by the tenant.

Please help to get the reimbursement from the tenant. Thanks.

Hi Selina

Hope you had a great weekend. 

I recently received a owners statement from the strata manager. The statement showed that there was a payment of $462 paid to the strata for repair of 

main gate which was caused by the residents of unit 5414 vandalising this gate. I was not aware of this issue however believe this should be borne by the tenant. 

Much appreciated if you could confirm if this was paid by the tenant?

Thanks for your help.

Kind regards

Frank

Hi Bowen,

We would like to assist however this issue with tiles outside shop fronts is within the lot space with the bitumen temporary repairs being on footpath.

Attached is strata plan showing the shops, PT 1, the tiles we believe are within the lot space, thick black line, and outside that is council footpath.

The contractors working on Kent Rd are to carry our remedial works once they have finished all the road widening I am not sure if they will include your tiles. 

Surendra do you have any information from contractors on the shops tiles?

"Hi Emma Curran

Thank you for your email.

Thank you for your email and vacating notice.

Your landlord wishes your tenancy to continue. Is there any request you would have us relay to your landlord? (such as rent reduction)

We can appreciate these are currently difficult and uncertain times where new accommodations may be difficult to obtain approval. 

In particular, the Government imposed social distancing restrictions limit the resident's ability to move in and out of premises. Spending extended periods of time moving furniture and being in confined spaces such as elevators may increase risk of exposure.

Please consider to stay and we believe the landlord will be happy to negotiate the rent.

Before you change your mind we confirm the lease termination date to be 18/09/2020.

By 12:00 PM 18/09/2020, please have all keys, fobs and garage and air conditioner remotes returned to our Sydney Olympic Park office.

In addition, find the attachment for the outstanding rent payment and outstanding invoices until your vacating and the final inspection guide.

For your information, total balance of rent and current invoices up to your vacating date is '$-1,628.57' (refer to attached status report). As per discussion, there is no break lease fee needs to be charged.

If you have large items requiring collection, kindly ensure the pick up is arranged prior to your vacating date. Any items remaining at the property will generally lead to additional costs incurred.

According to the cleaning, we recommend organizing cleaning to avoid any outstanding issue remaining the property which may affect your bond release. Note, access for work to the property will not be available once vacated.

"Hi Bowen，

*	A dead cockroach doesn't mean there's a pest problem here. It just means it's a cleaning issue. But it's fine if you have already finished pest control.

*	Sewer of the dishwasher may not be blocked. Sometimes it happens because the dishwasher was turned off suddenly when it is running. Please run the dishwasher once more in 60°C mode, the problem will be fixed. 

*	If there are other issues, please contact me in advance.

"Dear All

I am writing to complain on the services provided for the property management on my above property.

It's been more than a month since I last received your email and yet no update nor response has been provided to date.  The reimbursement money has been charged from my account without my prior knowledge and I have never been properly advised why it was charged and when. When I found out that it should have been reimbursed by the tenant, your staff said they she will check and then disappear. 

Please confirm when I can receive the reimbursement from the tenant. I also note there is a credit on my owners statement for October. Please advise when this was paid to me or if not when will it be paid. 

If I do not hear from you by COB on 4 December 2020, I will lodge a formal compliant to Fair Trading.

Hi Selina

Hope you had a great weekend. 

I recently received a owners statement from the strata manager. The statement showed that there was a payment of $462 paid to the strata for repair of 

main gate which was caused by the residents of unit 5414 vandalising this gate. I was not aware of this issue however believe this should be borne by the tenant. 

Much appreciated if you could confirm if this was paid by the tenant?

Thanks for your help.
