Can you please send someone out to fix our oven. It has stopped working. It does not produce heat. The fan still works and so does the grill. But no heat when on the oven setting. 

Thank you

"Hi George 

On a separate note, how much notice does the selling agent have to give us to hold a showing to prospective buyers? 

The selling agent is aggressively pushing us for an open this Saturday. We've put our foot down and have said no unless it's after 3pm on Saturday but I just want to make sure we are acting reasonably. 

Thanks

Please see diagram here:

Hopefully this gives a better idea of the damage and area that needs to be cut out.

Other closeups here:

It looks like the mould is contained to the shelf area and under, and not the full length.

Let me know if you have any questions or need any further info.

Subject: URGENT - Unit 22 1-13 Russell st baulkham hills - mould issue uncovered

Hi George 

This is absolutely the worst timing for this, however we've uncovered a mould problem in our sons bedroom. 

We were beginning to tidy up in preparation for the selling agent's photographer and we moved a bookshelf and have uncovered a pretty severe mould issue on the carpet. Please see photo attached. 

I called a carpet cleaning business (LTM Carpet Cleaning - https://maps.app.goo.gl/omFBc8CrBh6thcPg9) and he's indicated the carpet will need to be removed and replaced. He suggested cutting out the mould and patching it with a piece of carpet from inside the built in wardrobe if the landlord has just have any carpet off cuts. 

Lee from the carpet cleaning business said its also possible that the mould and moisture came from underneath the carpet (possibly an issue with the building and water getting into places during periods of heavy rain). We are aware that this bedroom sits on top of our neighbour's garage (unit 21) and during periods of heavy rain, the back wall of her garage is often wet and leaking water. The whole basement seems to leak in lots of places when it rains heavily. 

At this point I'm not sure if it's an issue for strata or an issue we need to be responsible for (I acknowledge the placement is also right next to the door so it's possible that rain got in and just seeped under the book case), however there is no mould ANYWHERE else in the room besides under the book case (I.e. not even closer to the door that would have gotten more water if rain got in).

I have to work tomorrow morning so I will call you sometime between 11-12 to discuss how we go about quickly removing the mouldy patch, fixing the carpet and working out who is responsible. 

We have covered up the mould patch with old linen to prevent mould spores from travelling (as suggested by the carpet guy), have sectioned off the room and have moved our son out of the room for now. 

Can you communicate with the landlord about whether they have carpet offcuts stored somewhere and if they want to halt the sale process of the property as well? Joven and I are also away (overseas and interstate between 11 June to 19 June - we let the selling agent know this as well but haven't notified them of the current mould issue). 

Sorry to drop this on you at the start of your working week. We'll chat tomorrow and go from there. 

Kind regards

Tara and Joven

Hi Shikha, 

ÃÂ 

Hope you are well and long time no talk. 

ÃÂ 

The subject line tenant reported the oven may have some issue with heating. 

ÃÂ 

I have suggested her to go through the manual and please find below email trail. 

ÃÂ 

I may suggest to engage an technician to attend, the quote from appliance guy is:

ÃÂ 

Re-approval repair limit is $390.00 and if over, they will not repair onsite and to provide a free quote for replacement or repair. 

ÃÂ 

Please kindly advise. 

ÃÂ 

With thanks

I did every thing I could using the manual guidelines and thought the oven was working properly again so I cooked a Moussaka last night.

I had it on 150 degrees, rather than the recommended 180.ÃÂ  It is meant to be cooked for 30-40 minutes but nothing worked, it was burnt in less than 10.

ÃÂ 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend!

ÃÂ 

Touching base on the below, our students have mentioned reading the manual and the oven not working properly.

Can you please arrange a technician to attend? And please let us know when they are planning to attend as we need to work around our studentsÃ¢ÂÂ schedules.

ÃÂ 

Another matter that I wanted to ask about. Our students mentioned that no action was taken from the building manager regarding the water leak we mentioned via email weeks ago, can you please confirm that this is correct? Was action taken maybe outside the building and not inside the apartments?

Thanks for all the help.

"Hi George,

We checked the gas cooktop when we were on-site.

There seems to be a problem with the ignition system. When you turn the ignition switch on, it kept making spark sound but the gas top cannot be lit up, the tenant has to use the lighter to start the gas top.

I have attached a short video for you reference.

Hope this information would help.ÃÂ

ÃÂ 

How are you? Hope this email finds you well.

We got some good promotion for this cooktop and will fit 12 & 16 East Street if the Electric Cooktop is not cover warranty and expensive to repair. 

If the East Street, Granville cooktop have more than 3 elements faulty or 2 elements with control panel faulty, replacing this Omega cooktop will be a good option. 

For the price of $699* including the supply of new cooktop, installation and remove the old one. 

*the cut out has to be the same, not including any wiring or modification work. 

ÃÂ 

Please help to let other PIA property manager knows if you managed 12 or 16 East St, Granville. 

Of course, if other properties can fit in, we can offer the same deal as well.

Thank you, stay safe!

"Hi Massimo & George,

Sorry could not update you quickly we have been very busy.

I tried all the troubleshooting and stuff, but it seems that the power supply to the dishwasher is not consistent.

Nothing is blocking the power supply as well and the filters are cleaned, and the machine is not locked.

Please let me know how to proceed further.

Hi George,

ÃÂ 

As this problem is a serious safety issue, I would rather to be fixed ASAP.

Also, I believe that the cooktop does not meet the Australian Safety Standard.

The flow of gas does not stop if the flame is blown away by wind or any other incident. This need to be checked and confirmed its conformity with the standards.

ÃÂ 

Please advise the first available time of your technicians and I try to make myself available.

Hi George,

ÃÂ 

Technicians came and fixed part of the problem.ÃÂ 

Sparking is fixed but the safety issue is still remaining and they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt fix it.

It needs urgent attention.

As this case is a serious safety issue for the whole building, I will report it to the building strata managers for their record and necessary actions.

Hi George,

ÃÂ 

As this problem is a serious safety issue, I would rather to be fixed ASAP.

Also, I believe that the cooktop does not meet the Australian Safety Standard.

The flow of gas does not stop if the flame is blown away by wind or any other incident. This need to be checked and confirmed its conformity with the standards.

Please advise the first available time of your technicians and I try to make myself available.

Please kindly find attached quote for repair or replace the gas stove.

Hi Qing, 

ÃÂ 

In short, 1.ÃÂ  Stove doctor can either repair at $272.00 INC GST or replace a Kardi Gas cooktop at $473.95 INC GST comes with 2 years warranty. 

ÃÂ 

2. Uneed electrical service quote for $200.00 INC GST to repair if found only one gas ignition faulty otherwise will be charged based on $140.00 service call+ parts basis. ÃÂ ÃÂ 

ÃÂ 

The suggestion we given at the beginning is let stove doctor to provide a free quote and fix it is under $150.00 ING GST, however, Stove advised the repair cost is $272.00. therefore send us the quote for repair and replacement.

Hi Qing,

Hope you are well.ÃÂ 

Further to yesterday email in relation to gas cook top ignition issue. Please refer to below email trail.ÃÂ 

I have obtained another quote from a service provider (Uneed electrical services) , please see details as follow:

For this cooktop if that is just the ignition issue base on your description, it should be around $200 in GST to repair. 

ÃÂ However, our call out fee is $140 in GST and plus any parts, in this case, parts cost $60 in GST. (as per for now)ÃÂ 

However, our call out fee is $140 in GST and plus any parts, in this case, parts cost $60 in GST. (as per for now) 

Please let us know what is the max allowance you would approve as well, sometime, we found little screw rust, or broken, rubber missing or broken.ÃÂ 

Generally speaking, Uneed can attend the repair if it is only one ignition issue at the cost $200.00 INC GST, otherwise will be $140 call out fee + parts.ÃÂ 

Could you kindly advise whether you would like to consider Uneed to attend the issue or stove doctor ?

Hi Qing, 

ÃÂ 

In short, 1.ÃÂ  Stove doctor can either repair at $272.00 INC GST or replace a Kardi Gas cooktop at $473.95 INC GST comes with 2 years warranty. 

ÃÂ 

2. Uneed electrical service quote for $200.00 INC GST to repair if found only one gas ignition faulty otherwise will be charged based on $140.00 service call+ parts basis. ÃÂ ÃÂ 

ÃÂ 

The suggestion we given at the beginning is let stove doctor to provide a free quote and fix it is under $150.00 ING GST, however, Stove advised the repair cost is $272.00. therefore send us the quote for repair and replacement.

Hi Qing,

Hope you are well.ÃÂ 

Further to yesterday email in relation to gas cook top ignition issue. Please refer to below email trail.ÃÂ 

I have obtained another quote from a service provider (Uneed electrical services) , please see details as follow:

For this cooktop if that is just the ignition issue base on your description, it should be around $200 in GST to repair. 

ÃÂ However, our call out fee is $140 in GST and plus any parts, in this case, parts cost $60 in GST. (as per for now)ÃÂ 

However, our call out fee is $140 in GST and plus any parts, in this case, parts cost $60 in GST. (as per for now) 

Please let us know what is the max allowance you would approve as well, sometime, we found little screw rust, or broken, rubber missing or broken.ÃÂ 

Generally speaking, Uneed can attend the repair if it is only one ignition issue at the cost $200.00 INC GST, otherwise will be $140 call out fee + parts.ÃÂ 

Could you kindly advise whether you would like to consider Uneed to attend the issue or stove doctor ?

Good morning George,

Please find attached condition reports and pictures. I agree with the agent's comments inÃÂ the report. I have added additional comments that were not covered in the conditional report. Please let me knowÃÂ if you have any questions.

There are few issues that need solving if possible. 

1. The power surges as soon as the clothes dryer is turned on with another appliance. for example, washing machine and dryer at the same time or dryer and heater at the same time. Can it be checked?

2. Master bedroom shower gets flooded while having a shower, that is, the water is draining very slowly. It's not a huge issue but if there is a blockage then it needs repairedÃÂ before it's completely blocked. 

3. Minor question - the dishwasher power cable comes out from the bottom shelf and the power plug is in the top shelf, do you know how it was connected because its quite short. Is there a particular way to plug in?

Finally, could you please let me know when my rent is due?

"Good morning George,

Please find attached condition reports and pictures. I agree with the agent's comments inÃÂ the report. I have added additional comments that were not covered in the conditional report. Please let me knowÃÂ if you have any questions.

There are few issues that need solving if possible. 

1. The power surges as soon as the clothes dryer is turned on with another appliance. for example, washing machine and dryer at the same time or dryer and heater at the same time. Can it be checked?

2. Master bedroom shower gets flooded while having a shower, that is, the water is draining very slowly. It's not a huge issue but if there is a blockage then it needs repairedÃÂ before it's completely blocked. 

3. Minor question - the dishwasher power cable comes out from the bottom shelf and the power plug is in the top shelf, do you know how it was connected because its quite short. Is there a particular way to plug in?

Finally, could you please let me know when my rent is due? 

Kind regards,

Nanda

It may take some strength to remove the cup and you can use some tools.

Hi George,
Thanks for arranging dish washing machine installation.

It is just installed.

Also I noticed the technician damaged back part of the cabinet shelf to make way for the plug as can be seen in attached photos. Just for future reference and your information.

How is it going!

ÃÂ 

Thank for all the information, and all your time taking care of my property.

ÃÂ 

And ÃÂ I am so glad to see that my property is maintained in a good shape by the tenants.ÃÂ 

So regarding to the mound and the fan, what will be the most economic cost of replacing with a brand new one, ÃÂ as it has been weakened and not doing what it is support to do, as well as considering the sake of tenant health.ÃÂ 

ÃÂ 

I also understand you have also helped me fixing with some other minor issues in the property, under your professional views and flexible ways of thinking, I really really and always appreciated that, knowing my property has always been in a good good hand George!

Hi Andy,

Hope this email finds you well.ÃÂ 

Please find attached routine inspection report.ÃÂ 

Only thingÃÂ  would like your attention is:

Mould on ensuite ceiling . Test ensuite exhaust fan found excessive motor noise. The air intake power may reduce and it probably reaches its life span. Already suggest tenant to use mould cleaner to clean the mould and keep air ventilation.

Inspection Report

Ã¯Â»Â¿Dear George,

ÃÂ 

How is it going!

ÃÂ 

Thank for all the
information, and all your time taking care of my property.

ÃÂ 

And ÃÂ I am so glad to see
that my property is maintained in a good shape by the tenants.ÃÂ 

So regarding to the mound and the fan, what will be the most economic cost of
replacing with a brand new one, ÃÂ as it has been weakened and not doing
what it is support to do, as well as considering the sake of tenant
health.ÃÂ 

ÃÂ 

I also understand you have
also helped me fixing with some other minor issues in the property, under your
professional views and flexible ways of thinking, I really really and always
appreciated that, knowing my property has always been in a good good hand
George!

ÃÂ 

Sorry for the late reply,
IÃ¢ÂÂve been busy with some of my personal stuffs recently, but It still so nice
to hear from you George, we talk later.

ÃÂ 

Be SAFE and HAPPY buddy!

ÃÂ 

Best

Hi Andy,

Hope this email finds you
well.ÃÂ 

Please find attached routine
inspection report.ÃÂ 

Only thingÃÂ  would like your
attention is:

Mould on ensuite ceiling . Test
ensuite exhaust fan found excessive motor noise. The air intake power may
reduce and it probably reaches its life span. Already suggest tenant to use
mould cleaner to clean the mould and keep air ventilation.

With thanksÃÂ

Please send us the paid bill once received. 

As far as I know it is first request from this building as NBN infrastructure is already in place, service provider normally should not charge.

Hi Niranga, 

Thanks for your email. 

If internet service provider confirms NBN is only way to contact internet, I will ask owner to reimburse the NBN new development fee (Not over $300.00 ) to you. 

The following condition has to be met to enable owner to do reimbursement;

1 . You will need to pay service provider first and request them to provide an invoice specifically statement it is for NBN new development fee (Not over $300.00) ; 

2. The NBN service address is 67/21-25 Seven Hill Rd, Baulkham Hills.

As I have informed you the other day I am unable to connect to NBN unless I pay $300 NBN development fee to NBNtm. They are charging this from first person whom ever gng to connect to NBN from the unit.

I don't wanna pay this connection fee because I think this connection is belong to the unit. I am attaching the chat history for your information that I had with the serviceÃÂ provider.

Subject: Something Weird of the kitchen circuit - 38 Shoreline Dr

Hi George,

Sorry to bother you again. 

Recently I found the circuit in the kitchen is behaving weirdly. 

The microwave sometimes beeping because of lowerÃÂ voltage I guess. And when that occurred, I turned on the range hood and it no longer beeped and worked again. 

I think it's weird then I tried to turn off the right RCB (the right one in the circle) and turn it on to see what will happen. I found that I can't totally turn it off, I can only make it to the middle position. Here is the picture.

<cid:17bcc6eb119a3196_0.0.2>

And when I turned it on, I can hear the current sound, and afterÃÂ several seconds, it disappears. And then after about 10 minutes, the microwave beep again and I fix it by opening the range hood.

I guess there is something wrong with that RCB that controlled the kitchen circuit. I have received the email about the repair during lockdown time. I'm not sure whether this is an urgent repair or not. It occurs about once per day or once every two days. 

Maybe we can have a call to talk about this situation because I think the only text in the email is difficult toÃÂ explain theÃÂ situation. Feel free to call me when you are available.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Something Weird of the kitchen circuit - 38 Shoreline Dr

Hi George,

Sorry to bother you again. 

Recently I found the circuit in the kitchen is behaving weirdly. 

The microwave sometimes beeping because of lowerÃÂ voltage I guess. And when that occurred, I turned on the range hood and it no longer beeped and worked again. 

I think it's weird then I tried to turn off the right RCB (the right one in the circle) and turn it on to see what will happen. I found that I can't totally turn it off, I can only make it to the middle position. Here is the picture.

<cid:image004.jpg@01D78203.45990D10>

And when I turned it on, I can hear the current sound, and afterÃÂ several seconds, it disappears. And then after about 10 minutes, the microwave beep again and I fix it by opening the range hood.

I guess there is something wrong with that RCB that controlled the kitchen circuit. I have received the email about the repair during lockdown time. I'm not sure whether this is an urgent repair or not. It occurs about once per day or once every two days. 

Maybe we can have a call to talk about this situation because I think the only text in the email is difficult toÃÂ explain theÃÂ situation. Feel free to call me when you are available.

Thanks for your help!

Kind Regards,

Zeyu Wang

Hi George

Trust that you are well.

We have been advised that the tenants from Unit 2/6 Sorrell Street PARRAMATTA have illegally dumped a microwave on Monday and then a mattress on Wednesday this week.

Could you urgently contact the tenants to have this removed asap.

If this has not been removed by COB tomorrow, the cost for removal will be charged back to the lot owners levy account.

Dear George,

I picked up the keys for 54/118 Adderton Rd, Carlingford on Thursday evening
and have started to move in. As I started to fill the kitchen cupboards with
my belongings, IÃ¢ÂÂve noticed a disgusting, thick layer of grease on top of
the kitchen cupboards. A broken microwave plate and a greasy folder of
manuals have also been left behind. I have discarded of the broken microwave
plate and have placed all manuals into another bag. I would normally clean
any missed spots myself however, the state of this is beyond what I feel is
fair. I understand that a cleaner came through to clean the apartment prior
to me taking over the lease but I can see that there has been no attempt at
all to clean this. Please see attached photos. IÃ¢ÂÂm wondering if you can
please organise someone to come back to fix this?

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear George

I am totally confused about this dishwasher invoice. When the dishwasher technician spoke to Danre regarding the repair on the day, he mentioned that the spigot in the pipe attached to the dishwasher had been installed incorrectly. (No holes were left to allow it to drain properly). You would see that the repair was done in the pipe work underneath the wash basin. If something was installed incorrectly, DanrÃÂ© can't be held responsible for the service call out and certainly there is no misuse by the tenant?

We would like you to review the decision to charge us for this.

"Dear George

I am totally confused about this dishwasher invoice. When the dishwasher technician spoke to Danre regarding the repair on the day, he mentioned that the spigot in the pipe attached to the dishwasher had been installed incorrectly. (No holes were left to allow it to drain properly). You would see that the repair was done in the pipe work underneath the wash basin.ÃÂ  If something was installed incorrectly, DanrÃÂ© canÃ¢ÂÂt be held responsible for the service call out and certainly there is no misuse by the tenant?

ÃÂ 

We would like you to review the decision to charge us for this.

ÃÂ 

Regards,

Coenraad Bekker & Danre Bekker

Hi Fiona, 

Hope you are well. 

I have advised the tenant to go through troubleshooting for a dishwasher and could not start a washing circle issue but the issue still occurs. 

Just wondering if would you like to arrange for this to be checked or if you would like us to get some quotes for you. 

For repair, it is not very economic as almost all dishwasher technicians will charge a call-out fee ranging from 165.00+ GST.ÃÂ  

Appliance guy, offers a $490.00 pre-approval repair limit for a dishwasher and if over, they will provide free quotes, however, a cheap dishwasher may be a more economic option. 

Please kindly advise your thoughts.

Just wanted to contact you about the unit's dishwasher. Recently it has stopped draining all the water out of it and has become unusable. See attached photo for reference.

I justÃÂ wanted to also follow up regarding your conversation with the owner relating to me keeping a pet.

Regards,

To: <actai837@gmail.com<mailto:actai837@gmail.com>>, <mary@crsyd.com<mailto:mary@crsyd.com>>

Hi Tai, 

Hope you are well. 

The subject line tenant reported the dishwasher is not working. Still has power and the control panel is not responding. 

The current dishwasher is Smeg Brand and is around 9 years old. I am not sure whether you would like to arrange a repair or replacement?

I have obtained the following quotes for your consideration :

1.	The applianceÃÂ guy requests a pre-approval repair limit of $490.00 which means if the repair cost is under $490.00, they will repair onsite ,otherwise, they will provide a free quote for repair and replacement quote;
2.	I can request a replacement quote first and you also can consider replacing instead of repairing as taking into the ages of the dishwasher, replacement may be a more economic option. 

I will send you the appliance guy dishwasher replacement quote once received.

Another thing is, good news, the tenant has accepted the rent increase to $460.00 per week from 29/08/2022.

With thanks

Hi George,

Thank you for your advice, however it is not the power point that isnÃ¢ÂÂt working as I have lights on the panel, it is the panel itself which no longer responds to any button being pressed. Either the panel is faulty or the control module has failed and I need a repairman.

Hi Graham, 

Thanks for your email. Will send you the lease renewal 2 weeks before the new rent effective date. 

For dishwasher, could you try whether the dishwasher power point is working , or use a power extension cord to connect from dishwasher from another power point. 

I also attached the manual and could you try a trouble shooting and let me know how it goes.

Hope this email finds you well.

We have received an email from the tenant in the above property. The tenant would like to know their electricity meter number or access to the electricity room for Origin to double-check it.

I can see the tenant has received an abnormal amount of electricity bill and it is worth investigating this case.

If you have any enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

To: Simon Jingchu Zhangpeng <simonzhangpeng@pia.com.au>

Hi Simon,

Hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to raise a concern with you regarding my electricity usage/bill. Back in June I received a $303 electricity bill for the one month I had lived at my address.

After this high bill charge I was careful and completely minimised my electricity usage. I turn appliances off from the switch and don't use the air-conditioning unit ever.ÃÂ 

I have just received my second electricity bill which is a shocking total of $898. This is extremely unsettling as I am a single man who works from 5am until 4pm 5 days a week. It would be impossible for me to use $9 of electricity a day which is what my bill is saying.ÃÂ 

I have a grave concern that someone is stealing electricity from me or that there are some crossed wires in the manhole above the connecting apartments. The man who connected the NBN from my house noticed there were lots of wires running from unit 1 to unit 8.ÃÂ 

Has anyone else in this block had a large electricity bills like mine? Is there any way you can help me in this situation? Or can you this be escalated to the strata management committee? If not I will have to take this matter to the electricity and water ombudsman.ÃÂ

Hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to raise a concern with you regarding my electricity usage/bill. Back in June I received a $303 electricity bill for the one month I had lived at my address. I thought this was strange and asked Origin (my electricity provider) to come and re-read the metre to confirm that this was accurate as it was a high bill charge. They seemed to think that this was accurate and so I paid the bill.

I have also spoken with my energy provider and they have stated this is more than the average house hold with a family. The first steps of investigation is to get access to the Meter and I require the Meter number linked to my unit so I will need to gain access to this. Please speak with the landlord to get to the bottom of this.

Hi Maria,

Hope this email finds you well.

We have received an email from the tenant in the above property. The tenant would like to know their electricity meter number or access to the electricity room for Origin to double-check it.

I can see the tenant has received an abnormal amount of electricity bill and it is worth investigating this case.

Hi George,ÃÂ 

Thanks for arranging this. The carpet cleaner has come however the floor is still extremely wet, furniture mouldy etc. Their suggestion was to keep fans on it constantly and that they may need to be called back outÃÂ 

Would you ok hiring this piece of equipment if available at Kennards if available?ÃÂ 

https://www.kennards.com.au/blower-dryer.html

Please keep me posted on when the strata inspection will happen

Thanks

DarcyÃÂ 

Ã¯Â»Â¿Hi Darcy,

Owner has approved to arrange a carpet cleaner to carry out water
extraction for you ASAP. This is only thing from owner side they can do
and we are also following up with strata for their action to inspect the
unit.

Hi George,

With the return of heavy rain our lounge room is again wet. An area
measuring ~4 x 4m of carpet is wet with the corner area being completely
saturated. This is causing damage to our furniture all of which we have
had to move to one side of the room. The space essentially un liveable
right now

Obviously this is something have brought up before during the last lot of
heavy rain. We urgently need someone to inspect both the source of the
water and the carpet/ underlay itself. Once this is done they can advise
on next steps as far as compensation and whether we can continue living in
this space safely

I look forward to your response

Dear Leo,

Hope this email finds you well. 

We have been notified that the dryer is not working. Please find the video attached. The Powerpoint working but the dryer cannot be turned on. 

Taking into the age of the dryer, the most economic way to repair is to replace it as the repair cost could be over $350.00. 

I have requested a dryer replacement quote and will let you know once received. 

Please let me know if you would like to replace the dryer from your end or arrange the repair by yourself. 

Hope the information assists and have a good week!

hi George

I checked it again.

The dryer can start but will stop after a few minutes even though just using ""Low"" heat and set to 20 minutes drying time. Near the Air intake shroud is quite hot when the dryer stops. ÃÂ It looks like overheating. ÃÂ The exhaust filter is found to be a pile of dirt. ÃÂ I vacuumed it. The Air Intake filter, exhaust vent shroud and lint filter are all cleaned but the problem remains. ÃÂ

I can pay for the exhaust filter as itÃ¢ÂÂs consumable. But the dryer stops even just a few towels without the exhaust filter.ÃÂ
